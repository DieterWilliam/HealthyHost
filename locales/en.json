				"Info": "\t• Have tooth or gum pain that gets worse or doesn’t go away.\n\t• Have gums that are red, swollen, or bleed easily.\n\t• Have a sore in your mouth that doesn’t heal.\n\t• Have a tooth sensitive to hot, cold, or pressure.\n\t• Have something wrong with your old dental restoration.\n\t• Lose a filling.\n\t• Have a dry mouth on a daily basis.\n\t• Experience pain or clicking noises in your jaw."
			}
		},
		"Good_Hygiene": {
			"0": {
				"Step": "Start children early",
				"Info": "• One in four young children develop signs of tooth decay before they start school. \n• 50% of all children between ages 12 to 15 develop cavities. \n• 1/7 (13%) adolescents age 12 to 19 years have at least one untreated decay tooth. \n• Beginning oral hygiene routine within the first few days after birth."
			},
			"1": {
				"Step": "Brush and Floss Properly",
				"Info": "• Twice a day for at least 2 min. \n• Ideally, use a piece of floss up to 18 inches in length, allowing you to use a fresh area of floss every few teeth without reinserting bacteria you just removed."
			},
			"2": {
				"Step": "Fluoride",
				"Info": "• Fluoride varnish works by increasing the concentration of fluoride in the outer surface of teeth, thereby enhancing fluoride uptake during early stages of de-mineralization. \n• Fluoride products such as toothpaste, mouth rinse, and dental office topicals have been shown to reduce caries (cavities) between 30% and 70% compared with no fluoride therapy."
			},
			"3": {
				"Step": "Know when to Replace the Toothbrush",
				"Info": "• Change toothbrush three to four times a year - or sooner if the bristles become irregular or frayed. \n• Always rinse your toothbrush with water after brushing and store it in an upright position. \n• Try to keep your toothbrush separate from the other toothbrush in the same holder to prevent cross contamination."
			},
			"4": {
				"Step": "Rinse or Chew Gum After Meal",
				"Info": "• The physical act of chewing increases salivary flow in the mouth; if chewed after eating, the increased salivary flow can help neutralize and wash away the acids that are produced when food is broken down by the bacteria in plaque on teeth. \n• Gum is an adjunct to brushing and flossing but chewing gum does not replace brushing and flossing. \n• Clinical studies have shown that chewing sugarless gum for 20 minutes following meals can help prevent tooth decay."
			},
			"5": {
				"Step": "Don’t Smoke or Use Tobacco",
				"Info": "• Losing your teeth before age 65 has also recently been associated with 50% increase in risk of death from all causes. \n• If you smoke or use tobacco, or regularly drink alcohol, you have an increased risk of developing lung or oral cancer as well as gum disease. \n• New tobacco users who use smokeless products are likely to experience bad breath, yellowish-brown stains on their teeth and mouth stores."
			},
			"6": {
				"Step": "Avoid Sugary Foods/ Control the Amount of Sugar",
				"Info": "• Avoid sugary foods that stay in your mouth for a long time, like hard, sticky or chewy varieties of candy. \n• Offer healthy snacks, such as cheese, fruits, yogurt, peanuts butter, chocolate milk and sugarless gum. \n• Save your sugary treats for the end of a meal before a tooth-brushing session, rather that throughout the day. \n• Substitute water for sugar-laden sodas and fruit juices. \n• Bacteria in your mouth digest the food you eat and specifically feed on the sugar, producing acids that can slowly dissolve tooth enamel and cause tooth decay."
			},
			"7": {
				"Step": "See a Dentist",
				"Info": "• Regular dental visits are important because they can help spot dental health problems early on when treatment is likely to be simpler and more affordable. \n• Even if you don’t have any symptoms, you can still have dental health problems that only a dentist can diagnose. Regularly dental visits will also help prevent problems from developing. \n• Some people need to visit the dentist once or twice a year, others may need more visits. You are a unique individual, with a unique smile and unique needs when it comes to keeping your smile healthy."

		"Diseases": {
			"0": {
				"Name": "Tooth Decay (Cavities)",
				"Symptoms": "A toothache",
				"Causes": "Dental plaque can lead to tooth decay and cavities. Cavities caused by breakdown of tooth enamel by acids produced by bacteria located in plaque on teeth, along gum-line and in crevices on chewing surface of teeth. Consuming foods high in carbohydrates cause the bacteria to produce acids responsible for causing outer coating of tooth enamel or root surface to decay.",
				"Treatment": "Daily brushing, flossing teeth, and rinsing with fluoride. Fluoride treatment can help restore tooth’s enamel and potentially reverse cavity in early stages. Fillings common when decay has progressed beyond earliest stages. Crowns are for extensive decay or weakened teeth, intended to replace tooth’s natural crown. Root canals repair and save badly damaged or infected tooth for when decay has reached inner material of tooth. Tooth extractions for teeth that have become so severely decayed they can't be restored or removed.",
				"Cost_Treatment": "With fillings, the cost is between $50 to $150 depending if you want silver or white fillings."
			},
			"1": {
				"Name": "Gingivitis",
				"Symptoms": "Red/swollen gums, gums blead easily",
				"Causes": "It is a mild form of gum disease. The bacteria cause inflammation of the gums. The longer plaque and tartar are on the teeth the more harmful they become. Result of infections and inflammation of the gums and bone that surround the teeth. Specific chronic conditions including, diabetes, weak immune system, and poor oral hygiene increases the individual’s risk of suffering from periodontal disease.",
				"Treatment": "Daily brushing and flossing, and regular cleaning by a dentist. If treatment is refused, bone that supports teeth can be lost, and gums can be infected. Eventually leading to teeth loss because of the lack of bone support.",
				"Cost_Treatment": "The cost of a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and/or possible routine cleaning range from $4-$75."
			},
			"2": {
				"Name": "Periodontitis",
				"Symptoms": "Swollen gums, bleeding gums, loss of tooth",
				"Causes": "When gingivitis is not treated, it can advance to periodontitis (which means inflammation around the tooth). Gums pull away from the teeth and form spaces called “pockets” that become infected. These are infections that harm the gum and bone that hold teeth in place. If not treated, the bones, gums, and tissue that support the teeth can be destroyed. The teeth may eventually become loose and have to be removed.",
				"Treatment": "Must go to and be perform by a professional. They will decide what measures to take, either a nonsurgical treatment or a surgical treatment.",
				"Cost_Treatment": "The cost to treat Gingivitis varies with the severity of the disease it can start from $75 – $3,600."
			},
			"3": {
				"Name": "Tooth Loss",
				"Symptoms": "Swollen gums, bleeding gums, loss of tooth",
				"Causes": "Usually caused by cavities and periodontal diseases which it affects the ages of 65–74.",
				"Treatment": "Keep brushing your teeth, flossing teeth, and rinse with a fluoride and antiseptic mouthwash daily.",
				"Cost_Treatment": "The cost of treating tooth loss varies with the complexity of where the tooth starts at $300 - $1,000."
			},
			"4": {
				"Name": "Oral Cancer",
				"Symptoms": "Painful swallowing, pain in the mouth or ear",
				"Causes": "High risk behaviors like, tobacco, alcohol use of any kind.",
				"Treatment": "Early detection, surgery in the mouth and radiation therapy.",
				"Cost_Treatment": "Depends on what stage the cancer is; it could go for around $60,000 and chemo drugs would be between $15,000–$20,000 dollars per cycle."

		"Background": "Healthy House, a non-profit which trains professional healthcare interpreters, is dedicated to addressing health disparities in the cultural communities of the Central Valley of California, one of the most diverse areas in the country. \n\nIts Healthy Host program, in collaboration with the UC engineering and Project Protect student groups, has developed this application to address the serious issue of the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Since the discovery of these miracle drugs, doctors have been relying on antibiotics to treat many illnesses common to the public. \n\nHowever, the common overuse of antibiotics to treat viral infections, for which they are ineffective, has created a crisis of very resistant bacteria that exhibit limited or no response to antibiotics. This has led to the prescribing of stronger and larger amounts of antibiotics, further exacerbating the problem. Additionally, antibiotics are frequently misused. For example, when patients don’t complete their full course of treatment with antibiotics, the effectiveness of the medication is compromised. In addition, members of cultural communities often procure antibiotics through underground or unregulated sources. This contributes to the misuse of antibiotics that are too strong or not appropriate for the respective illnesses being targeted. \n\nIt is with high hopes that this ‘app’ helps promote understanding of the serious health crisis of antibiotic resistance and what can be done to prevent it."
